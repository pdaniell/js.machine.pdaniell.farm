A Javascript Finite State Machine Library 

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
 provides an description of *finite state machines*: 

>A **finite-state machine** (**FSM**) or **finite-state automaton**
(plural: *automata*), or simply a **state machine**, is a mathematical
model of computation used to design both computer programs and
sequential logic circuits. It is conceived as an abstract
machine that can be in one of a finite number of *states*. The
machine is in only one state at a time; the state it is in at any given
time is called the *current state*. It can change from one state to
another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is
called a *transition*. A particular FSM is defined by a list of its
states, and the triggering condition for each transition.

>The behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern
society which perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a
sequence of events with which they are presented. Simple examples are
vending machines which dispense products when the proper combination
of coins is deposited, elevators which drop riders off at upper
floors before going down, traffic lights which change sequence when
cars are waiting, and combination locks which require the input of
combination numbers in the proper order.

>Finite-state machines can model a large number of problems, among which
are electronic design automation, communication protocol design,
language parsing and other engineering applications. In biology
and artificial intelligence research, state machines or hierarchies
of state machines have been used to describe neurological systems
and in linguisticsâ€”to describe the grammars of natural
languages.


The library `machine.js` provides simple and easy to use 
Javascript implementations of such machines including finite state automata, 
finite state transducers, and Turing machines.
